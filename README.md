# BhasaApp
The application has been developed to serve as a language translator, specifically from Nepali to Japanese. 
In addition to providing translation capabilities, the application also offers pronunciation guidance and written suggestions in romanized English.
The inclusion of Japanese voice for speech output enhances the overall user experience, adding a touch of elegance to the application's functionality.
